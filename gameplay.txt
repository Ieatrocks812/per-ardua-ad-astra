Game Overview

Title (MVP): Per Ardua ad Astra – Battle of Britain

Camera: 2D side-view.

Player Aircraft: Spitfire (single variant for MVP).

Enemies: Bf 109 (fighter), Ju 88 (bomber).

Modes: 7-mission Campaign + Endless Survival.

Narrative: Light character arc with immortal wingman (cannot die in MVP).

Controls (default)

Pitch: A/D (left/right).

Throttle: W/S (up/down).

Roll / Snap invert (optional): F.

Fire: Left Mouse / Space.

Jettison Drop Tank: R.

Physics Requirements

Thrust-to-Weight (TWR): 1.5.

Velocity Integration:

vel += thrustVector * thrust - dragCoeff * vel - gravity (2D).

Clamp top speed by engine tier.

Lift Approximation:

lift = liftCoeff * airspeed * cos(AoA) used to modulate climb/descend feel.

Stall Model:

Track airspeed and angle of attack (AoA).

Stall threshold: airspeed < V_stall && |AoA| > AoA_stall for t_stall >= 0.4s.

Effects: Nose auto-drops, reduced control authority, mild screen shake.

Recovery: Throttle up + nose-down for t_recover ≈ 0.6s.

Fuel: Constant burn; extra capacity if Drop Tank equipped. Jettison removes drag penalty.

Damage Model (Simplified 2D)

Hit Zones (Spitfire & Bf 109):

Engine: speed/climb debuff; smoke; possible flame at low HP.

Wings L/R: roll/turn-rate debuff per wing; visual spark/smoke.

Pilot: incapacitation → mission fail.

Hit Zones (Ju 88):

Engine x2: speed loss; may drop from formation.

Fuselage: overall HP.

Tail Gun Arc: cone-based return fire.

Armor Modifiers: From Armor modification (+/−% damage taken; trade-off with handling).

Weapons & Loadouts

Modifications (pick 1 pre-mission):

8× .303 Browning – high RoF, low damage per bullet.

2× 20mm Hispano + 4× .303 – balanced punch/weight.

4× 20mm Hispano – high damage, heavier handling (−turn rate / +recoil spread).

Armor Options – More Armor (−speed/−turn, +DR) / Less Armor (+speed/+turn, −DR).

Drop Tank – +fuel, +drag until jettison.

Ballistics (abstracted):

Raycast or fast projectile with lifetime clamp.

Per-weapon: rpm, spreadDeg, damage, muzzleVel, recoilKick.

Upgrades (Permanent)

Bubble Canopy: Reduces enemy spotting highlight delay (UI effect).

Pressurized Cockpit: Small high-altitude performance bonus (optional/no-op if altitude not modeled; keep as future hook).

Engine Upgrade (Merlin → Griffon): +top speed, +acceleration, +climb (scalar multipliers).

Passive Ability

Enemy Identification: Tint/outline enemies in red; toggleable when unlocked (Mission 2 reward).

UI/UX

Minimal HUD (airspeed bar, throttle %, ammo, fuel, damage icons by zone, compass bearing, objective markers).

Pre-mission Loadout: choose 1 modification; show purchased upgrades; passive toggle if unlocked.

Debrief: results, tokens earned, damage summary, dialogue.
