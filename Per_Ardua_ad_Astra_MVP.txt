1. Overview

This MVP is a short, self-contained version of Per Ardua ad Astra covering the British side of the Battle of Britain, from training to Battle of Britain Day.

Tone: Light character narrative between player and wingman, set against escalating combat.

Scope: One playable aircraft (Spitfire), two enemy aircraft (Bf 109 fighter, Ju 88 bomber).

Physics & Feel: Bit Planes-style side-view combat with inertia and responsive controls, but with stalls possible (Thrust-to-Weight Ratio = 1.5 → stalls rare).

Progression: Bomber Crew-style mission chain with upgrades, modifications, and a single passive ability.

Extra Mode: Endless combat survival after campaign completion.

2. Core Gameplay Loop

Mission Briefing – Story dialogue + mission objectives.

Loadout Selection – Choose one modification, apply any upgrades purchased, equip passive (if unlocked).

Combat Mission – Control the Spitfire in 2D airspace; wingman fights alongside.

Mission Debrief – Results summary, rewards (upgrade tokens), story dialogue.

Progression – Purchase upgrades, unlock modifications, equip passive.

---

3. Player & Wingman
Player

Aircraft: Spitfire (single type for MVP).

Physics:

Thrust-to-weight ratio: 1.5.

Stall occurs if airspeed < stall threshold for > X seconds, nose drops, control limited until recovery.

No g-force simulation.

Wingman

Character: Named, persistent through all missions, cannot die in MVP.

Behavior:

Algorithmic (not adaptive AI).

Default: flies in formation, breaks off to engage threats, returns to cover player.

Scripted radio chatter (pre/post/mid mission) tied to mission events.

---

4. Mission Structure
Total Missions: 7

Tutorial / Training – Learn controls, basic dogfighting vs dummy targets.

Scouting – Recon mission; small Bf 109 skirmish. Unlocks Enemy Identification passive.

Defense #1 – Intercept Ju 88s + light fighter escort. Earn 1 upgrade token.

Defense #2 (Ace) – Heavy raid on airfield; Bf 109 Ace appears. Defeating Ace awards 1 upgrade token and special Ace radio line.

Patrol – Low-intensity mission; mixed contacts. Earn 1 upgrade token.

Defense #3 – Large bomber formation + escorts. Earn 1 upgrade token.

Final Milestone – Battle of Britain Day – Large-scale defense, multiple waves. Victory ends campaign.

5. Combat & Physics
Controls

Pitch: A/D or left/right.

Throttle: W/S or up/down.

Roll: Keybind (optional for 2D stall recovery animation). (F key)

Fire Guns: Primary fire button. (space key)

Special: Drop tank jettison. (E key)

Physics: 

Side-view 2D plane with inertia, gravity, drag, and lift simulation.

Stalls possible at low speed + high angle of attack; recovery requires nose-down and throttle.

TWR 1.5 ensures aggressive maneuvering without frequent stalling.

---

6. Aircraft Systems
Modifications (choose one per mission)

8×.303 Browning – Default; high RoF, low damage.

2×20 mm Hispano + 4×.303 Browning – Balanced firepower.

4×20 mm Hispano – Heavy damage, reduced maneuverability.

Armor Options – More armor (slower, tougher) / Less armor (faster, weaker).

Drop Tanks – Extra fuel, slight drag penalty until jettison.

Upgrades (permanent, purchased with tokens)

Bubble Canopy – Better visibility; reduces enemy spotting delay.

Pressurized Cockpit – Minor high-altitude performance boost.

Engine Upgrade (Merlin → Griffon) – Faster climb and top speed.

Passive Abilities

Enemy Identification – Enemy planes tinted red; unlocked after Mission 2.

---

7. Enemy Aircraft

Bf 109 Fighter

Agile, moderate health, armed with cannons and MGs.

Uses fixed dogfighting behavior: approach, burst fire, break, re-engage.

Ju 88 Bomber

Slow, high health, tail gun arc.

Flies in formations; requires sustained fire to down.

Ace Variant

Bf 109 with higher stats, tighter turns, disciplined burst firing.

---

8. Damage Model (Simplified)

Hit Zones

Engine: Reduces speed, may cause smoke/failure.

Wing L/R: Reduces roll rate and turn.

Pilot: Instant incapacitation (mission fail).

Bomber Engines: Reduce bomber speed, drop from formation.

Effects

Flat damage reduction/bonus from armor mod.

Critical hits trigger smoke/fire particle effects.

---

9. Endless Combat Mode

Unlocks after campaign completion.

Infinite waves with scaling difficulty:

Increase spawn rate, formation size, and enemy accuracy.

Scoreboard for kills, survival time.

Uses same upgrades/mods as campaign.

---

10. Art & Audio Direction (MVP)

Art

2D side-view silhouettes or minimal pixel sprites (64–128px wide).

Distinct shapes for Spitfire, Bf 109, Ju 88.

Visible muzzle flashes, tracers, smoke.

Audio

Looping engine sound per aircraft type.

Single SFX for gunfire, explosions.

Wingman radio chatter as short text + optional voice lines.

---

11. Technical Requirements

Engine: Godot 4 (recommended for speed) or Unity 2D.

Target FPS: 120+ on low-end hardware.

Platform: PC (Steam-ready build).

Data: Missions and upgrades stored in JSON for easy iteration.

12. Development Notes

All enemy and wingman behavior scripted (no dynamic AI learning).

All missions are hand-authored (no procedural campaigns).

Physics tuned for responsiveness; realism is secondary to fun.

Stall is a visible, recoverable event, not an instant loss of control.
