Notes

Keep art minimal (silhouettes or low-res pixel); readability over realism.

Wingman cannot die; if critically damaged, exits and sits out next mission at most once.

All AI is state-machine driven with timers and simple heuristics; no learning.

TWR 1.5 with stall model: stalls are possible but rare and recoverable.
