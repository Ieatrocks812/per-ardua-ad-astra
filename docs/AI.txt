Philosophy

Algorithmic, not adaptive AI. Scripted states and timers with light randomness. Wingman cannot die.

Shared Behaviors (FSM)

States: FormUp → Engage → Break → Reposition → CoverLeader → RTB (if damaged).

FormUp

Maintain offset from leader (wingman) or formation anchor (enemies).

Engage

If target in cone & range: burst fire; else turn to intercept.

Time-on-target clamp; avoid endless tail-chase by break timer.

Break

Defensive roll/zoom; pick new vector ± random jitter.

Reposition

Climb/extend to regain energy; re-enter from advantaged angle.

CoverLeader (Wingman only)

If player flagged UnderFire: intercept attacker with high priority.

RTB (Wingman only)

If wingman HP < threshold: attempt to disengage and exit map; marked Unavailable next mission at most once; always returns later (cannot die).

Target Selection

Fighters: prioritize player > player’s attacker > nearest threat.

Bombers: prioritize formation leaders/engines; escorts protect bombers.

Ace Behavior (Bf 109)

+10–15% stats (speed/turn/accuracy), shorter burst, smarter break timing.

Uses vertical extensions more often; favors head-on denial.

Bomber Formation Logic (Ju 88)

Spawn in V or Line Abreast with interval.

Tail gun fires if attacker within cone & range; cooldown bursts.

Engines disabled reduce group speed; stragglers may fall behind.
