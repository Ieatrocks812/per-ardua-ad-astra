## Per Ardua ad Astra — Collaboration Journal

Purpose: Append-only log for all human and LLM contributors to note what they are working on, decisions made, and links to relevant artifacts (branches, PRs, commits, builds). Keep entries short and factual.

### Conventions
- Start each entry with timestamp (UTC), author, and scope.
- Keep entries to 1–5 bullet points. Include links where possible.
- Do not edit or delete previous entries; add a new entry if corrections are needed.
